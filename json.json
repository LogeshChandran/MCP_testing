If none are mentioned, default to an empty list.\n    - **meeting_title**: If the user doesn't provide a title, default to \"Meeting\".\n    - **meeting_desc**: Compose a brief description of the meeting based on the meeting_title. If you can't derive a description, leave it blank\n    - **room_name**: If the user doesn't specify a room, leave it as an empty string.\n    - **building_name**: The building can be either \"orion\" or \"phonix\". If the user doesn't specify a building, default to \"phonix\".\n    - **meeting_id**:  This is ONLY required if the user is canceling, rescheduling, or modifying a meeting.  Otherwise, leave it as null.\n\n    User Query:\n    {user_query}\n\n    JSON Output:\n    \"\"\"\n\n    model = Llama3() #replace it by your model \n    json_output = model.generate(prompt)\n\n    #add validation\n    try:\n        meeting_details = MeetingDetails.parse_raw(json_output)\n        return meeting_details\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error during validation: {e}\")\n        print(f\"raw output from LLM: {json_output}\")\n        raise e\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    user_query = \"Book a meeting tomorrow at 10:00 AM with John and Jane to discuss the project status in building orion.\"\n    meeting_details = extract_meeting_details(user_query)\n    print(meeting_details.json(indent=2))\n\n    user_query_cancel = \"cancel meeting id 123\"\n    meeting_details_cancel = extract_meeting_details(user_query_cancel)\n    print(meeting_details_cancel.json(indent=2))\n```\n\nThis code defines a Pydantic model `MeetingDetails` to structure the extracted data.  The `extract_meeting_details` function takes a user query as input, constructs a prompt for Llama 3, and uses the model to generate a JSON output.  It then validates the JSON output against the `MeetingDetails` model and returns a `MeetingDetails` object.  The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with different user queries and prints the resulting JSON output.\n\nTo use this, you will need to replace `from llama3 import Llama3` with your actual Llama3 implementation.  The `model.generate(prompt)` line also needs to be updated to correctly call your Llama 3 model. The example at the end shows how to call the function and prints the json output, including a test with a cancellation query.\n\nIf you'd like to apply this code to a file, you can use the Apply button on the code block.

This restricts the allowed values for these fields to the specified options (e.g., \"orion\" or \"phonix\" for `building_name`). If the LLM returns a value outside of these options, Pydantic validation will fail and raise an exception.\n*   **Updated Prompt:** The prompt is modified to instruct the LLM that `action` MUST be one of the specified values and `building_name` MUST be either \"orion\" or \"phonix\". This guides the LLM to produce valid outputs.\n\nYou can apply these changes using the Apply button, or switch to Agent Mode to apply the updates automatically.\n"

The `extract_meeting_details` function takes a user query as input, constructs a prompt for Llama 3, and uses the model to generate a JSON output.  It then validates the JSON output against the `MeetingDetails` model and returns a `MeetingDetails` object.  The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with different user queries and prints the resulting JSON output.\n\nTo use this, you will need to replace `from llama3 import Llama3` with your actual Llama3 implementation.  The `model.generate(prompt)` line also needs to be updated to correctly call your Llama 3 model. The example at the end shows how to call the function and prints the json output, including a test with a cancellation query.\n\nIf you'd like to apply this code to a file, you can use the Apply button on the code block.  Alternatively, you can switch to Agent Mode using the Mode Selector dropdown to have the changes applied automatically.\n\n\n<user>\nhow to add condition if building_name only actept phonix or orion ? pass to llm ? same way to action also ?\n\n",

The fields may contain varied terminology across different insurance contracts. Extract the relevant data based on the mappings and business logic provided below.\n---\n### **Business Logic and Calculations:**\n1. **Deductible Calculation:**\n- The deductible is the amount the insured must pay out of pocket before the insurance starts covering the costs.\n- For example, if the total medical bill is $5,000 and the deductible is $1,000, subtract $1,000 from the total bill to get the remaining balance.\n2. **Coinsurance Calculation:**\n- After the deductible is met, coinsurance applies. The insured person will pay a percentage of the remaining bill.\n- For example, if the remaining balance after the deductible is $4,000, and the insured has a 20% coinsurance, the insured will pay 20% of $4,000.\n3. **Out of Pocket Calculation:**\n- The \"Out of Pocket (Overall)\" is the total amount the insured person will need to pay, including both the deductible and coinsurance.\n- Example: The insured pays $1,000 deductible + $800 coinsurance = $1,800 in out-of-pocket costs.\n4. **Out of Pocket Remaining:**\n- This refers to the remaining out-of-pocket expenses that the insured needs to pay. If the insured has already met their deductible or coinsurance, this value should reflect any remaining portion.\n---\n?"

The prompt is structured with clear instructions, input/output formats, and business logic/constraints. This structured approach should help the LLM to extract the required information more accurately and consistently.\n\nKey improvements and explanations:\n\n*   **Objective:** Sets the overall goal for the LLM.\n*   **Instructions:** Provides a step-by-step guide for the LLM to follow.\n*   **Input/Output Formats:** Clearly defines the expected input (user query) and output (JSON) formats.\n*   **Business Logic and Constraints:** This is the most important part. It provides detailed rules and guidelines for extracting and standardizing the data, including:\n    *   Action determination logic.\n    *   Date and time handling (defaulting to today if not provided, null if time not provided).\n    *   Participant extraction.\n    *   Meeting title defaulting.\n    *   Location constraints (orion/phonix).\n    *   Conditional meeting ID requirement.\n*   **Pydantic Model:** Explicitly includes the Pydantic model schema in the prompt so the LLM knows exactly what structure to generate.\n*   **Clear Language:** Uses clear and concise language to avoid ambiguity.\n*   **Emphasis:** Uses MUST, ONLY to emphasize critical constraints.\n\nTo apply this code, you can use the Apply button, or you can switch to Agent Mode using the Mode Selector dropdown.\n"

The `extract_meeting_details` function takes a user query as input, constructs a prompt for Llama 3, and uses the model to generate a JSON output.  It then validates the JSON output against the `MeetingDetails` model and returns a `MeetingDetails` object.  The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with different user queries and prints the resulting JSON output.\n\nTo use this, you will need to replace `from llama3 import Llama3` with your actual Llama3 implementation.  The `model.generate(prompt)` line also needs to be updated to correctly call your Llama 3 model. The example at the end shows how to call the function and prints the json output, including a test with a cancellation query.\n\nIf you'd like to apply this code to a file, you can use the Apply button on the code block.  Alternatively, you can switch to Agent Mode using the Mode Selector dropdown to have the changes applied automatically.\n\n\n<user>\nhow to add condition if building_name only actept phonix or orion ? pass to llm ? same way to action also ?\n\n<assistant>\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nfrom datetime import date, time\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nclass MeetingDetails(BaseModel):\n    action: Literal[\"meetingbooking\", \"cancel\", \"reschedule\", \"modify\", \"recommendation\"] = Field(description=\"One of: meetingbooking, cancel, reschedule, modify, recommendation\")\n    startdate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    starttime: time = Field(default=\"\", description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    enddate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    endtime: time = Field(default=\"\", description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    required_participants: List[str = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"List of participant names, defaults to empty list\")\n    meeting_title: str = Field(default=\"Meeting\", description=\"Defaults to 'Meeting' if not provided\")\n    meeting_desc: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Description of the meeting, compose based on meeting_title\")\n    room_name: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Defaults to empty string\")\n    building_name: Literal[\"orion\", \"phonix\"] = Field(default=\"phonix\", description=\"One of: orion, phonix.

If the LLM returns a value outside of these options, Pydantic validation will fail and raise an exception.\n*   **Updated Prompt:** The prompt is modified to instruct the LLM that `action` MUST be one of the specified values and `building_name` MUST be either \"orion\" or \"phonix\". This guides the LLM to produce valid outputs.\n\nYou can apply these changes using the Apply button, or switch to Agent Mode to apply the updates automatically.\n\n\n<user>\ni need prompt link this ai\n# **Prompt: Insurance Eligibility and Claims Data Extraction**\n**Objective:**\nYou are tasked with extracting and standardizing 15 key data points from the provided insurance eligibility JSON response. Ensure that all values are accurately calculated using the provided business logic, and return the results in a structured JSON format.\n---\n### **Instructions:**\n1. **Input Format:**\nYou will receive a JSON response containing the insurance details for a patient. The fields may contain varied terminology across different insurance contracts. Extract the relevant data based on the mappings and business logic provided below.\n---\n### **Business Logic and Calculations:**\n1. **Deductible Calculation:**\n- The deductible is the amount the insured must pay out of pocket before the insurance starts covering the costs.\n- For example, if the total medical bill is $5,000 and the deductible is $1,000, subtract $1,000 from the total bill to get the remaining balance.\n2. **Coinsurance Calculation:**\n- After the deductible is met, coinsurance applies. The insured person will pay a percentage of the remaining bill.\n- For example, if the remaining balance after the deductible is $4,000, and the insured has a 20% coinsurance, the insured will pay 20% of $4,000.\n3. **Out of Pocket Calculation:**\n- The \"Out of Pocket (Overall)\" is the total amount the insured person will need to pay, including both the deductible and coinsurance.\n- Example: The insured pays $1,000 deductible + $800 coinsurance = $1,800 in out-of-pocket costs.\n4. **Out of Pocket Remaining:**\n- This refers to the remaining out-of-pocket expenses that the insured needs to pay. If the insured has already met their deductible or coinsurance, this value should reflect any remaining portion.\n---\n?\n\n",

The `extract_meeting_details` function takes a user query as input, constructs a prompt for Llama 3, and uses the model to generate a JSON output.  It then validates the JSON output against the `MeetingDetails` model and returns a `MeetingDetails` object.  The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with different user queries and prints the resulting JSON output.\n\nTo use this, you will need to replace `from llama3 import Llama3` with your actual Llama3 implementation.  The `model.generate(prompt)` line also needs to be updated to correctly call your Llama 3 model. The example at the end shows how to call the function and prints the json output, including a test with a cancellation query.\n\nIf you'd like to apply this code to a file, you can use the Apply button on the code block.  Alternatively, you can switch to Agent Mode using the Mode Selector dropdown to have the changes applied automatically.\n\n\n<user>\nhow to add condition if building_name only actept phonix or orion ? pass to llm ? same way to action also ?\n\n<assistant>\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nfrom datetime import date, time\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nclass MeetingDetails(BaseModel):\n    action: Literal[\"meetingbooking\", \"cancel\", \"reschedule\", \"modify\", \"recommendation\"] = Field(description=\"One of: meetingbooking, cancel, reschedule, modify, recommendation\")\n    startdate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    starttime: time = Field(default=\"\", description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    enddate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    endtime: time = Field(default=\"\", description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    required_participants: List[str = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"List of participant names, defaults to empty list\")\n    meeting_title: str = Field(default=\"Meeting\", description=\"Defaults to 'Meeting' if not provided\")\n    meeting_desc: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Description of the meeting, compose based on meeting_title\")\n    room_name: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Defaults to empty string\")\n    building_name: Literal[\"orion\", \"phonix\"] = Field(default=\"phonix\", description=\"One of: orion, phonix.

Otherwise, leave it as null.\n \n     User Query:\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n*   **Pydantic `Literal` for validation:** The `action` and `building_name` fields in the `MeetingDetails` model now use `Literal` from the `typing` module. This restricts the allowed values for these fields to the specified options (e.g., \"orion\" or \"phonix\" for `building_name`). If the LLM returns a value outside of these options, Pydantic validation will fail and raise an exception.\n*   **Updated Prompt:** The prompt is modified to instruct the LLM that `action` MUST be one of the specified values and `building_name` MUST be either \"orion\" or \"phonix\". This guides the LLM to produce valid outputs.\n\nYou can apply these changes using the Apply button, or switch to Agent Mode to apply the updates automatically.\n\n\n<user>\ni need prompt link this ai\n# **Prompt: Insurance Eligibility and Claims Data Extraction**\n**Objective:**\nYou are tasked with extracting and standardizing 15 key data points from the provided insurance eligibility JSON response. Ensure that all values are accurately calculated using the provided business logic, and return the results in a structured JSON format.\n---\n### **Instructions:**\n1. **Input Format:**\nYou will receive a JSON response containing the insurance details for a patient. The fields may contain varied terminology across different insurance contracts. Extract the relevant data based on the mappings and business logic provided below.\n---\n### **Business Logic and Calculations:**\n1. **Deductible Calculation:**\n- The deductible is the amount the insured must pay out of pocket before the insurance starts covering the costs.\n- For example, if the total medical bill is $5,000 and the deductible is $1,000, subtract $1,000 from the total bill to get the remaining balance.\n2. **Coinsurance Calculation:**\n- After the deductible is met, coinsurance applies. The insured person will pay a percentage of the remaining bill.\n- For example, if the remaining balance after the deductible is $4,000, and the insured has a 20% coinsurance, the insured will pay 20% of $4,000.\n3. **Out of Pocket Calculation:**\n- The \"Out of Pocket (Overall)\" is the total amount the insured person will need to pay, including both the deductible and coinsurance.\n- Example: The insured pays $1,000 deductible + $800 coinsurance = $1,800 in out-of-pocket costs.\n4. **Out of Pocket Remaining:**\n- This refers to the remaining out-of-pocket expenses that the insured needs to pay. If the insured has already met their deductible or coinsurance, this value should reflect any remaining portion.\n---\n?\n\n<assistant>\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nfrom datetime import date, time\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nclass MeetingDetails(BaseModel):\n    action: Literal[\"meetingbooking\", \"cancel\", \"reschedule\", \"modify\", \"recommendation\"] = Field(description=\"One of: meetingbooking, cancel, reschedule, modify, recommendation\")\n    startdate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    starttime: time = Field(default=None, description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    enddate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    endtime: time = Field(default=None, description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    required_participants: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"List of participant names, defaults to empty list\")\n    meeting_title: str = Field(default=\"Meeting\", description=\"Defaults to 'Meeting' if not provided\")\n    meeting_desc: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Description of the meeting, compose based on meeting_title\")\n    room_name: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Defaults to empty string\")\n    building_name: Literal[\"orion\", \"phonix\"] = Field(default=\"phonix\", description=\"One of: orion, phonix.

It handles phrases like \"next Friday\", \"Monday\", \"next month 1st\", etc. If a date is found, it returns a `datetime` object; otherwise, it returns `None`.  The `fuzzy=True` argument allows `dateutil` to extract dates even if they are embedded within other text.\n*   **Date Extraction and Prompt Injection:**\n    *   Before calling the LLM, the code now calls `extract_date_from_query` to pre-process the user query and attempt to find a date.\n    *   If a date is found, it's passed to the LLM in the prompt:  `The startdate has been detected to be {start_date}`. The prompt instructs the LLM to use this date.  This is a form of \"prompt injection,\" guiding the LLM towards the pre-extracted date, but still allowing it to use its own understanding of the query.\n\nWith these changes, the code will now attempt to extract dates like \"Monday\", \"next Friday\", or \"next month 1st\" from the user query before passing it to the LLM.  The extracted date is then injected into the prompt, guiding the LLM to use that date for the `startdate`.\n\nYou can apply these changes using the Apply button, or you can switch to Agent Mode using the Mode Selector dropdown.\n"

The `extract_meeting_details` function takes a user query as input, constructs a prompt for Llama 3, and uses the model to generate a JSON output.  It then validates the JSON output against the `MeetingDetails` model and returns a `MeetingDetails` object.  The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with different user queries and prints the resulting JSON output.\n\nTo use this, you will need to replace `from llama3 import Llama3` with your actual Llama3 implementation.  The `model.generate(prompt)` line also needs to be updated to correctly call your Llama 3 model. The example at the end shows how to call the function and prints the json output, including a test with a cancellation query.\n\nIf you'd like to apply this code to a file, you can use the Apply button on the code block.

This restricts the allowed values for these fields to the specified options (e.g., \"orion\" or \"phonix\" for `building_name`). If the LLM returns a value outside of these options, Pydantic validation will fail and raise an exception.\n*   **Updated Prompt:** The prompt is modified to instruct the LLM that `action` MUST be one of the specified values and `building_name` MUST be either \"orion\" or \"phonix\". This guides the LLM to produce valid outputs.\n\nYou can apply these changes using the Apply button, or switch to Agent Mode to apply the updates automatically.\n\n\n<user>\ni need prompt link this ai\n# **Prompt: Insurance Eligibility and Claims Data Extraction**\n**Objective:**\nYou are tasked with extracting and standardizing 15 key data points from the provided insurance eligibility JSON response. Ensure that all values are accurately calculated using the provided business logic, and return the results in a structured JSON format.\n---\n### **Instructions:**\n1. **Input Format:**\nYou will receive a JSON response containing the insurance details for a patient. The fields may contain varied terminology across different insurance contracts. Extract the relevant data based on the mappings and business logic provided below.\n---\n### **Business Logic and Calculations:**\n1. **Deductible Calculation:**\n- The deductible is the amount the insured must pay out of pocket before the insurance starts covering the costs.\n- For example, if the total medical bill is $5,000 and the deductible is $1,000, subtract $1,000 from the total bill to get the remaining balance.\n2. **Coinsurance Calculation:**\n- After the deductible is met, coinsurance applies. The insured person will pay a percentage of the remaining bill.\n- For example, if the remaining balance after the deductible is $4,000, and the insured has a 20% coinsurance, the insured will pay 20% of $4,000.\n3. **Out of Pocket Calculation:**\n- The \"Out of Pocket (Overall)\" is the total amount the insured person will need to pay, including both the deductible and coinsurance.\n- Example: The insured pays $1,000 deductible + $800 coinsurance = $1,800 in out-of-pocket costs.\n4. **Out of Pocket Remaining:**\n- This refers to the remaining out-of-pocket expenses that the insured needs to pay. If the insured has already met their deductible or coinsurance, this value should reflect any remaining portion.\n---\n?\n\n<assistant>\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nfrom datetime import date, time\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nclass MeetingDetails(BaseModel):\n    action: Literal[\"meetingbooking\", \"cancel\", \"reschedule\", \"modify\", \"recommendation\"] = Field(description=\"One of: meetingbooking, cancel, reschedule, modify, recommendation\")\n    startdate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    starttime: time = Field(default=None, description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    enddate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    endtime: time = Field(default=None, description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    required_participants: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"List of participant names, defaults to empty list\")\n    meeting_title: str = Field(default=\"Meeting\", description=\"Defaults to 'Meeting' if not provided\")\n    meeting_desc: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Description of the meeting, compose based on meeting_title\")\n    room_name: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Defaults to empty string\")\n    building_name: Literal[\"orion\", \"phonix\"] = Field(default=\"phonix\", description=\"One of: orion, phonix.

The `extract_meeting_details` function takes a user query as input, constructs a prompt for Llama 3, and uses the model to generate a JSON output.  It then validates the JSON output against the `MeetingDetails` model and returns a `MeetingDetails` object.  The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with different user queries and prints the resulting JSON output.\n\nTo use this, you will need to replace `from llama3 import Llama3` with your actual Llama3 implementation.  The `model.generate(prompt)` line also needs to be updated to correctly call your Llama 3 model. The example at the end shows how to call the function and prints the json output, including a test with a cancellation query.\n\nIf you'd like to apply this code to a file, you can use the Apply button on the code block.

This restricts the allowed values for these fields to the specified options (e.g., \"orion\" or \"phonix\" for `building_name`). If the LLM returns a value outside of these options, Pydantic validation will fail and raise an exception.\n*   **Updated Prompt:** The prompt is modified to instruct the LLM that `action` MUST be one of the specified values and `building_name` MUST be either \"orion\" or \"phonix\". This guides the LLM to produce valid outputs.\n\nYou can apply these changes using the Apply button, or switch to Agent Mode to apply the updates automatically.\n\n\n<user>\ni need prompt link this ai\n# **Prompt: Insurance Eligibility and Claims Data Extraction**\n**Objective:**\nYou are tasked with extracting and standardizing 15 key data points from the provided insurance eligibility JSON response. Ensure that all values are accurately calculated using the provided business logic, and return the results in a structured JSON format.\n---\n### **Instructions:**\n1. **Input Format:**\nYou will receive a JSON response containing the insurance details for a patient. The fields may contain varied terminology across different insurance contracts. Extract the relevant data based on the mappings and business logic provided below.\n---\n### **Business Logic and Calculations:**\n1. **Deductible Calculation:**\n- The deductible is the amount the insured must pay out of pocket before the insurance starts covering the costs.\n- For example, if the total medical bill is $5,000 and the deductible is $1,000, subtract $1,000 from the total bill to get the remaining balance.\n2. **Coinsurance Calculation:**\n- After the deductible is met, coinsurance applies. The insured person will pay a percentage of the remaining bill.\n- For example, if the remaining balance after the deductible is $4,000, and the insured has a 20% coinsurance, the insured will pay 20% of $4,000.\n3. **Out of Pocket Calculation:**\n- The \"Out of Pocket (Overall)\" is the total amount the insured person will need to pay, including both the deductible and coinsurance.\n- Example: The insured pays $1,000 deductible + $800 coinsurance = $1,800 in out-of-pocket costs.\n4. **Out of Pocket Remaining:**\n- This refers to the remaining out-of-pocket expenses that the insured needs to pay. If the insured has already met their deductible or coinsurance, this value should reflect any remaining portion.\n---\n?\n\n<assistant>\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nfrom datetime import date, time\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nclass MeetingDetails(BaseModel):\n    action: Literal[\"meetingbooking\", \"cancel\", \"reschedule\", \"modify\", \"recommendation\"] = Field(description=\"One of: meetingbooking, cancel, reschedule, modify, recommendation\")\n    startdate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    starttime: time = Field(default=None, description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    enddate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    endtime: time = Field(default=None, description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    required_participants: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"List of participant names, defaults to empty list\")\n    meeting_title: str = Field(default=\"Meeting\", description=\"Defaults to 'Meeting' if not provided\")\n    meeting_desc: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Description of the meeting, compose based on meeting_title\")\n    room_name: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Defaults to empty string\")\n    building_name: Literal[\"orion\", \"phonix\"] = Field(default=\"phonix\", description=\"One of: orion, phonix.

It handles phrases like \"next Friday\", \"Monday\", \"next month 1st\", etc. If a date is found, it returns a `datetime` object; otherwise, it returns `None`.  The `fuzzy=True` argument allows `dateutil` to extract dates even if they are embedded within other text.\n*   **Date Extraction and Prompt Injection:**\n    *   Before calling the LLM, the code now calls `extract_date_from_query` to pre-process the user query and attempt to find a date.\n    *   If a date is found, it's passed to the LLM in the prompt:  `The startdate has been detected to be {start_date}`. The prompt instructs the LLM to use this date.  This is a form of \"prompt injection,\" guiding the LLM towards the pre-extracted date, but still allowing it to use its own understanding of the query.\n\nWith these changes, the code will now attempt to extract dates like \"Monday\", \"next Friday\", or \"next month 1st\" from the user query before passing it to the LLM.  The extracted date is then injected into the prompt, guiding the LLM to use that date for the `startdate`.\n\nYou can apply these changes using the Apply button, or you can switch to Agent Mode using the Mode Selector dropdown.\n\n\n<user>\nnext monday, next friday next month this all are not working ?\n\n",

The `extract_meeting_details` function takes a user query as input, constructs a prompt for Llama 3, and uses the model to generate a JSON output.  It then validates the JSON output against the `MeetingDetails` model and returns a `MeetingDetails` object.  The example usage demonstrates how to use the function with different user queries and prints the resulting JSON output.\n\nTo use this, you will need to replace `from llama3 import Llama3` with your actual Llama3 implementation.  The `model.generate(prompt)` line also needs to be updated to correctly call your Llama 3 model. The example at the end shows how to call the function and prints the json output, including a test with a cancellation query.\n\nIf you'd like to apply this code to a file, you can use the Apply button on the code block.

Ensure that all values are accurately calculated using the provided business logic, and return the results in a structured JSON format.\n---\n### **Instructions:**\n1. **Input Format:**\nYou will receive a JSON response containing the insurance details for a patient. The fields may contain varied terminology across different insurance contracts. Extract the relevant data based on the mappings and business logic provided below.\n---\n### **Business Logic and Calculations:**\n1. **Deductible Calculation:**\n- The deductible is the amount the insured must pay out of pocket before the insurance starts covering the costs.\n- For example, if the total medical bill is $5,000 and the deductible is $1,000, subtract $1,000 from the total bill to get the remaining balance.\n2. **Coinsurance Calculation:**\n- After the deductible is met, coinsurance applies. The insured person will pay a percentage of the remaining bill.\n- For example, if the remaining balance after the deductible is $4,000, and the insured has a 20% coinsurance, the insured will pay 20% of $4,000.\n3. **Out of Pocket Calculation:**\n- The \"Out of Pocket (Overall)\" is the total amount the insured person will need to pay, including both the deductible and coinsurance.\n- Example: The insured pays $1,000 deductible + $800 coinsurance = $1,800 in out-of-pocket costs.\n4. **Out of Pocket Remaining:**\n- This refers to the remaining out-of-pocket expenses that the insured needs to pay. If the insured has already met their deductible or coinsurance, this value should reflect any remaining portion.\n---\n?\n\n<assistant>\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nfrom datetime import date, time\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nclass MeetingDetails(BaseModel):\n    action: Literal[\"meetingbooking\", \"cancel\", \"reschedule\", \"modify\", \"recommendation\"] = Field(description=\"One of: meetingbooking, cancel, reschedule, modify, recommendation\")\n    startdate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    starttime: time = Field(default=None, description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    enddate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    endtime: time = Field(default=None, description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    required_participants: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"List of participant names, defaults to empty list\")\n    meeting_title: str = Field(default=\"Meeting\", description=\"Defaults to 'Meeting' if not provided\")\n    meeting_desc: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Description of the meeting, compose based on meeting_title\")\n    room_name: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Defaults to empty string\")\n    building_name: Literal[\"orion\", \"phonix\"] = Field(default=\"phonix\", description=\"One of: orion, phonix.

It handles phrases like \"next Friday\", \"Monday\", \"next month 1st\", etc. If a date is found, it returns a `datetime` object; otherwise, it returns `None`.  The `fuzzy=True` argument allows `dateutil` to extract dates even if they are embedded within other text.\n*   **Date Extraction and Prompt Injection:**\n    *   Before calling the LLM, the code now calls `extract_date_from_query` to pre-process the user query and attempt to find a date.\n    *   If a date is found, it's passed to the LLM in the prompt:  `The startdate has been detected to be {start_date}`. The prompt instructs the LLM to use this date.  This is a form of \"prompt injection,\" guiding the LLM towards the pre-extracted date, but still allowing it to use its own understanding of the query.\n\nWith these changes, the code will now attempt to extract dates like \"Monday\", \"next Friday\", or \"next month 1st\" from the user query before passing it to the LLM.  The extracted date is then injected into the prompt, guiding the LLM to use that date for the `startdate`.\n\nYou can apply these changes using the Apply button, or you can switch to Agent Mode using the Mode Selector dropdown.\n\n\n<user>\nnext monday, next friday next month this all are not working ?\n\n<assistant>\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nfrom datetime import date, time, datetime\nfrom typing import Literal\nimport re\nfrom dateutil.parser import parse\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\n\nclass MeetingDetails(BaseModel):\n    action: Literal[\"meetingbooking\", \"cancel\", \"reschedule\", \"modify\", \"recommendation\"] = Field(description=\"One of: meetingbooking, cancel, reschedule, modify, recommendation\")\n    startdate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    starttime: time = Field(default=None, description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    enddate: date = Field(default_factory=date.today, description=\"YYYY-MM-DD format, defaults to today\")\n    endtime: time = Field(default=None, description=\"HH:mm:SS format, defaults to empty string\")\n    required_participants: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description=\"List of participant names, defaults to empty list\")\n    meeting_title: str = Field(default=\"Meeting\", description=\"Defaults to 'Meeting' if not provided\")\n    meeting_desc: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Description of the meeting, compose based on meeting_title\")\n    room_name: str = Field(default=\"\", description=\"Defaults to empty string\")\n    building_name: Literal[\"orion\", \"phonix\"] = Field(default=\"phonix\", description=\"One of: orion, phonix.

The query MUST include the 'meeting_id' and the new date and/or time.\n            - **modify**: The user wants to change other details of an existing meeting, such as participants, room, or building. The query MUST include the 'meeting_id' and the details to be changed.\n            - **recommendation**: The user is asking for a meeting room recommendation based on certain criteria (e.g., number of participants, available dates/times).\n        - If the query clearly indicates canceling, rescheduling, or modifying, ensure 'meeting_id' is also extracted.\n\n        2. **Date and Time Handling:**\n        - **startdate**:  The startdate has been detected to be {start_date}. Use this date as the final startdate. The user query is {user_query}.\n        - **starttime**: If the user doesn't provide a specific time, leave it as null. Use HH:mm:SS format.\n        - **enddate**: If the user doesn't provide a specific date, default to today's date. Use YYYY-MM-DD format.\n        - **endtime**: If the user doesn't provide a specific time, leave it as null. Use HH:mm:SS format.\n\n        3. **Participants Extraction:**\n        - **required_participants**: Extract all participant names mentioned in the query. If none are mentioned, default to an empty list.\n\n        4. **Meeting Title and Description:**\n        - **meeting_title**: If the user doesn't provide a title, default to \"Meeting\".\n        - **meeting_desc**: Compose a brief description of the meeting based on the meeting_title. If you can't derive a description, leave it blank.\n\n        5. **Location Details:**\n        - **room_name**: If the user doesn't specify a room, leave it as an empty string.\n        - **building_name**: The building MUST be either \"orion\" or \"phonix\".

Otherwise, leave it as null.\n\n        ---\n\n        User Query:\n        {user_query}\n\n        JSON Output:\n        \"\"\"\n    else:\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        **Objective:**\n        You are an expert at extracting information from user queries to create structured JSON data for meeting room booking. \n        Your task is to extract the relevant information from the user query and represent it as a JSON object that conforms to the following Pydantic model. Ensure that all values adhere to the specified constraints and formats.\n\n        ---\n        **Instructions:**\n\n        1. **Input Format:**\n        You will receive a user query containing the meeting details. Extract the relevant data based on the specifications provided below.\n\n        2. **Output Format:**\n        You will generate a JSON object conforming to the following Pydantic model:\n\n        {MeetingDetails.schema_json(indent=2)}\n\n        ---\n        **Business Logic and Constraints:**\n\n        1. **Action Determination:**\n        - Determine the primary action the user wants to perform. It MUST be one of the following:\n            - **meetingbooking**: The user wants to schedule a new meeting.  The query should include details like date, time, participants, and optionally, the room and building.\n            - **cancel**: The user wants to cancel an existing meeting. The query MUST include the 'meeting_id'.\n            - **reschedule**: The user wants to change the date and/or time of an existing meeting. The query MUST include the 'meeting_id' and the new date and/or time.\n            - **modify**: The user wants to change other details of an existing meeting, such as participants, room, or building. The query MUST include the 'meeting_id' and the details to be changed.\n            - **recommendation**: The user is asking for a meeting room recommendation based on certain criteria (e.g., number of participants, available dates/times).\n        - If the query clearly indicates canceling, rescheduling, or modifying, ensure 'meeting_id' is also extracted.\n\n        2. **Date and Time Handling:**\n        - **startdate**: If the user doesn't provide a specific date, default to today's date. Use YYYY-MM-DD format.  Try to extract date like monday, friday, next friday, next month 1st .\n        - **starttime**: If the user doesn't provide a specific time, leave it as null. Use HH:mm:SS format.\n        - **enddate**: If the user doesn't provide a specific date, default to today's date. Use YYYY-MM-DD format.\n        - **endtime**: If the user doesn't provide a specific time, leave it as null. Use HH:mm:SS format.\n\n        3. **Participants Extraction:**\n        - **required_participants**: Extract all participant names mentioned in the query. If none are mentioned, default to an empty list.\n\n        4. **Meeting Title and Description:**\n        - **meeting_title**: If the user doesn't provide a title, default to \"Meeting\".\n        - **meeting_desc**: Compose a brief description of the meeting based on the meeting_title. If you can't derive a description, leave it blank.\n\n        5. **Location Details:**\n        - **room_name**: If the user doesn't specify a room, leave it as an empty string.\n        - **building_name**: The building MUST be either \"orion\" or \"phonix\". If the user doesn't specify a building, default to \"phonix\".\n\n        6. **Meeting ID (Conditional):**\n        - **meeting_id**: This is ONLY required if the user is canceling, rescheduling, or modifying a meeting. Otherwise, leave it as null.\n\n        ---\n\n        User Query:\n        {user_query}\n\n        JSON Output:\n        \"\"\"\n\n    model = Llama3() #replace it by your model\n    json_output = model.generate(prompt)\n\n    #add validation\n    try:\n        meeting_details = MeetingDetails.parse_raw(json_output)\n        return meeting_details\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error during validation: {e}\")\n        print(f\"raw output from LLM: {json_output}\")\n        raise e\n\ndef extract_date_from_query(query: str) -> Optional[datetime]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts a date from the user query using dateutil.parser.\n\n    Args:\n        query: The user's query as a string.\n\n    Returns:\n        A datetime object if a date is found, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Attempt to parse the date using dateutil.parser.parse\n        return parse(query, fuzzy=True, dayfirst=False, ignoretz=True)\n    except ValueError:\n        # If no date is found, return None\n        return None\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    user_query = \"Book a meeting next monday at 10:00 AM with John and Jane to discuss the project status in building orion.\"\n    meeting_details = extract_meeting_details(user_query)\n    print(meeting_details.json(indent=2))\n\n    user_query_cancel = \"cancel meeting id 123\"\n    meeting_details_cancel = extract_meeting_details(user_query_cancel)\n    print(meeting_details_cancel.json(indent=2))\n\n    user_query_next_month = \"Book a meeting next month at 10:00 AM with John and Jane to discuss the project status in building orion.\"\n    meeting_details_next_month  = extract_meeting_details(user_query_next_month )\n    print(meeting_details_next_month.json(indent=2))\n\n    user_query_next_friday = \"Book a meeting next friday at 10:00 AM with John and Jane to discuss the project status in building orion.\"\n    meeting_details_next_friday  = extract_meeting_details(user_query_next_friday )\n    print(meeting_details_next_friday.json(indent=2))\n```\n\n```diff\n--- a/main.py\n+++ b/main.py\n@@ -136,7 +136,7 @@\n \n def extract_date_from_query(query: str) -> Optional[datetime]:\n     \"\"\"\n-    Extracts a date from the user query using dateutil.parser.\n+    Extracts a date from the user query using dateutil.parser..\n \n     Args:\n         query: The user's query as a string.\n@@ -146,7 +146,7 @@\n     \"\"\"\n     try:\n         # Attempt to parse the date using dateutil.parser.parse\n-        return parse(query, fuzzy=True, dayfirst=False)\n+        return parse(query, fuzzy=True, dayfirst=False, ignoretz=True)\n     except ValueError:\n         # If no date is found, return None\n         return None\n```\n\nKey improvements:\n\n*   **`ignoretz=True` in `dateutil.parser.parse`:** Added the `ignoretz=True` argument to the `parse` function. This tells `dateutil` to ignore any timezone information in the input string. Timezone information can sometimes interfere with date parsing, especially with relative dates like \"next Monday\".\n*   **Clearer Instructions:** Modified prompt to make it explicitly clear that the LLM should use the pre-extracted `start_date`.\n\nThese changes should improve the accuracy of date extraction for phrases like \"next monday\", \"next friday\" and \"next month\".\n\nYou can apply these changes using the Apply button, or switch to Agent Mode using the Mode Selector dropdown.\n\n\n<user>\nany posiable way, we can do it from prompting ? and passing today's date and time and day ?\n\n",
